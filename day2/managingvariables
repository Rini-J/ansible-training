2. How to call a variable
in the beginning of the line
"{{ var_name }}" - Quote the variable
"{{ var_name }} is user1" - Quote the complete line if variable is followed by some text
this is {{ var_name }} - variable is defined in normal curly braces if anywhere in the line.

3. how to manage a variable
ansible variable precedence - 2.7
        command line values (eg “-u user”)
        role defaults [1]
        inventory file or script group vars [2]
        inventory group_vars/all [3]
        playbook group_vars/all [3]
        inventory group_vars/* [3]
        playbook group_vars/* [3]
        inventory file or script host vars [2]
        inventory host_vars/* [3]
        playbook host_vars/* [3]
        host facts / cached set_facts [4]
        play vars
        play vars_prompt
        play vars_files
        role vars (defined in role/vars/main.yml)
        block vars (only for tasks in block)
        task vars (only for the task)
        include_vars
        set_facts / registered vars
        role (and include_role) params
        include params
        extra vars (always win precedence)
