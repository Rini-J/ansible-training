## Ansible.cfg can also be kept into project dir.
# /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is the defalt configuration file with lowest priority.
# Common user "~/.ansible.cfg" file for the particular user.
# Project wise ansible dir can be specified in project dir
# $ANSIBLE_CONFIG variable is the highest priority.
# Ansible config doesnt have a parent directory structure,
# Recommendation is to create ansible.cfg and inventory file is to be kept in the same directory.
# every single project should have its own configuration file and inventories.
#
